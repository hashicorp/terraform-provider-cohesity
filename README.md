## <a name ="building-the-provider"></a> Building The Provider :pencil2:

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-cohesity`

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-cohesity $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-cohesity
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-cohesity
$ make build
```

The provider binary can be found in `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## <a name ="using-the-provider"></a> Using the provider :arrow_forward:

The Cohesity provider documentation can be found on [provider's website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/cohesity/index.html)

## <a name ="developing-the-provider"></a> Developing the Provider :hammer_and_pick:

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.12.6+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-cohesity
...
```
In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```
In order to run a specific acceptance test, change the variables in acceptance_test_variables.go to suit your environment and run `make testacc`

*Note:* Set the environment variables for configuring the Cohesity provider and sensitive resource arguments not set in the acceptance_test_variables.go file

```sh
$ make testacc TEST=./cohesity TESTARGS='-run=TestAccVirtualEditionCluster_basic'
```
